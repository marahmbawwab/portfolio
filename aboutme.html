<p style="margin-top: 40px;">  
    Hi, I am writing to express my interest in the Frontend Development training with React Js afforded by Gaza Sky Geeks(GSG).<br><br>
    After doing my research on GSG, read about GSG training programs, and how they are beneficial,<br> 
    they really resonated with me and  I can clearly see how my goals align with the purposes of this training.<br><br> 
    
    I have 2 years of work experience as a backend developer for Progineer Technologies.<br> 
    I specialized in developing backend APIs in C over Linux environments, testing them, exporting data to SQL and NO SQL databases,<br> 
    and trying to make the results as efficient as possible.<br><br>

    Currently, I am in between jobs and I would like to follow my passion and changes my career path to Frontend web Development.<br>
    When I am not coding, I really dedicate myself to spending most of my time with my lovely family.<br><br>
    
    I would love to be a part of the training as I have a passion for front-end development <br> and participating in this training will help me to increase my knowledge 
    in this field and will help me a lot during my job search journey for front-end developer roles.<br><br>
